# Local 1Password authentication configuration
# This file configures how Ansible connects to 1Password on the local machine

# 1Password authentication method - uncomment the method you prefer:

# Method 1: Use service account token (recommended for automation)
# Set this as an environment variable or use ansible-vault to encrypt it
# op_service_account_token: "{{ lookup('env', 'OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN') | default(lookup('ansible.builtin.env', 'OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN'), true) }}"

# Method 2: Use existing 1Password session (for interactive use)
# If you're already signed into 1Password CLI, no additional configuration needed
# The lookup plugin will use your existing session

# Method 3: Use master password authentication (less secure, for development only)
# Store master password in ansible-vault encrypted file
# op_master_password: !vault |
#   $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
#   ...encrypted master password...

# 1Password account configuration (optional, if you have multiple accounts)
# op_subdomain: "your-account"  # Your 1Password account subdomain
# op_username: "your-email@domain.com"  # Your 1Password username
# op_secret_key: "A3-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX"  # Your secret key

# Default vault name for lookups (can be overridden per lookup)
default_vault: "Homelab"

# Enable debug mode for 1Password lookups (for troubleshooting)
op_debug: false
